# Image Manipulation with NumPy and K-means
This project is a student assignment that explores basic image processing techniques using Python and libraries like NumPy and PIL. An experiment with binarization, contour detection, and color clustering with the K-means algorithm.

## Features
- Binarization – Convert images to black and white based on threshold values
- Contour Detection – Identify and highlight objects in an image
- Color Clustering – Group image colors using K-means

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- PIL
